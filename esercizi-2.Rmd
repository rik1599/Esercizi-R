## Compito del 4 febbraio 2019

Let us consider the dataframe `wages`, which containes information about
3294 USA working individuals. The data are taken from the National
Longitudinal Survey and are related to 1987. The variable as are listed
below and the output of the `str` command is given

| A data frame with 3294 observations on the following 4 variables.
| exper
|    experience in years
| male
|   1 male, 0 female
| school
|    years of schooling
| wage
|    wage (in 1980\$) per hour
| region
|    Center, North, South

```{r echo=FALSE, printr.help.sections="format"}
wages <- read.table("./data/Wages-New.txt", header = TRUE)
wages$male <- factor(wages$male)
wages$region <- factor(wages$region)
str(wages)
```

The aim of the study is to analyze the potential relationship between
the response variable wage and the explanatory variables considered in
the dataframe. Describe how to perform a preliminary data analysis on
this dataframe, using suitable R commands. Moreover, consider the
following plots and discuss the possibility of measuring the variable
`wage` in the logarithmic scale

![](img/img4.png)

In order to describe the effect of the factor male on the response
log(wage) we may analize this plot, where the probability distribution
of log(wage) is represented by considering the kernel density estimates
conditioned on the two levels (1 male, 0 female) of the variable male

![](img/img5.png)

With the commands `mod.0<-lm(log(wage) ∼ male,data=wages)` and
`mod.1<-lm(log(wage) ∼ exper*male, data=wages)`, two regression models
are defined for describing the potential effect of male and exper on the
response log(wage). Comment the model fitting outcomes given by the
function summary (Hint: consider the fact that the average years of
experience in the sample is lower for women than for men).

```{r echo=FALSE}
mod.0 <- lm(log(wage) ~ male,data=wages)
mod.1 <- lm(log(wage) ~ exper*male, data=wages)

summary(mod.0)
summary(mod.1)
```

Finally, a complete regression model is fitted
`mod.2 <- lm(log(wage) ∼., data=wages)` and the following output is
obtained by the R function summary.

```{r echo=FALSE}
summary(lm(log(wage) ~., data=wages))
```

Describe how to interpret these results, and then suggest how to proceed
with further analyses.

## Compito del 21 febbraio 2019

Let us consider the data frame loan, which contains information about
42,535 loans ranging from 1,000 \$ to 35,000 \$, issued by a company
called Lending Club. The following variables are considered: good (the
behaviour of the client with values good and bad), fico (the FICO credit
score measuring the client credit worthiness), purpose (the intended use
of the loan, with 8 different categories), loan amt (the credit amount
in \$) and income (the annual income in \$ of the client). The variable
as are listed below and the output of the str command is given

```{r echo=FALSE, printr.help.sections="format"}
loan <- read.table("./data/loan.txt", header = TRUE)
loan$good <- factor(loan$good)
loan$purpose <- factor(loan$purpose)
str(loan)
```

Moreover, the output of the command summary is also given

```{r echo=FALSE}
summary(loan)
```

The aim of the study is to analyze the potential relationship between
the response variable good and the explanatory variables considered in
the data frame, in order to evaluate the possible good/bad behaviour of
a customer. Describe how to perform a preliminary data analysis on this
data frame, using suitable R commands. Moreover, consider and discuss
the following plots

![](img/img6.png)

In order to describe the effect of the factor fico on the response good
we consider a simple logistic regression model fitted using the command
`mod.1<-glm(good ∼ fico, data = loan, family = "binomial")`. Comment the
model fitting outcomes given by the function summary and the output
given by the subsequent commands.

```{r}
mod.1 <- glm(good ~ fico, data = loan, family = "binomial")
summary(mod.1)

exp(coef(mod.1))
test <- data.frame(fico=c(700,750))
test$pred <- predict(mod.1,test, type="response")
test
```

Two further logistic regression models are fitted using
`mod.2<-glm(good ∼ fico + loan_amnt, data = loan, family = "binomial")`
and
`mod.3<-glm(good ∼ fico + loan_amnt + income + purpose, data = loan, family = "binomial")`.
Comment the corresponding output obtained by the R function summary and
then suggest how to proceed with a further predictive analysis.

```{r echo=FALSE}
summary(glm(good ~ fico + loan_amnt, data = loan, family = "binomial"))
summary(glm(good ~ fico + loan_amnt + income + purpose, data = loan, family = "binomial"))
```

at the Baystate Medical Centre, Springfield, Massachusetts during 1986.
The focus is on the variables listed below

```{r echo=FALSE, printr.help.sections="format"}
library(MASS)
help("birthwt")
```

The aim of the study is to analyze the potential relationship between
the response variable bwt and the explanatory variables age and race.
Describe how to perform a preliminary data analysis on this dataframe
using suitable R commands and comment the following plots

![](img/img7.png)

In order to describe the potential relationship between birth weight and
age, taking into account also the factor race, we compare the following
nested models

```{r}
bwt.lm1 <- lm(bwt ~ 1 , data = birthwt)
bwt.lm2 <- lm(bwt ~ age, data = birthwt)
bwt.lm3 <- lm(bwt ~ race + age, data = birthwt)
bwt.lm4 <- lm(bwt ~ race*age, data = birthwt)
```

Describe the four models and comment the results given by the Analysis
of Variance Table, reported below. Moreover, propose some alternative
model selection procedures.

```{r}
anova(bwt.lm1, bwt.lm2, bwt.lm3, bwt.lm4)
```

Let us consider Model 3 and comment the output obtained by the R
functions summary and plot.

## Compito del 18 febbraio 2020

Let us consider the dataframe wine, which contains information about 178
samples of wines grown in the same region in Italy. The cultivar of each
wine sample is observed (variable cultivar, with labels 1, 2, 3),
together with the concentration of the 13 different chemicals (variables
V1-V13). Describe how to perform a preliminary data analysis on this
dataframe using suitable R commands and comment the following outputs.

```{r}
wine <- read.table("./data/wine.txt", header = TRUE)
summary(wine)
sapply(wine[2:14],sd)
```

Moreover, discuss the results given by the scatterplot matrix considered
below, which considers the first 5 numerical variables, with colours
indicating cultivar 1 (black), cultivar 2 (red) and cultivar 3 (blue).

![](img/img9.png)

The aim of the study is to adequately synthesize the information given
by the original variables V1-V13, in order to capture as much of the
information as possible. A further objective is to use some of these new
derived variable for distinguishing the three different cultivars. The
Principal Components Analysis procedure is applied. Present the main
features of this stati- stical procedure, describe the arguments
specified below in the function princomp and discuss the output of the
function loadings.

```{r}
wine.pca <- princomp(wine[2:14], cor=TRUE)
loadings(wine.pca)[,1:4]
```

Moreover, discuss the following graphical outputs
